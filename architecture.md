  - CryptoMetrics Collector
    - responsbile for getting metrics for each crypto asset we support
    - will need to be run periodically
    - at first, this will just be daily price for each crypto asset from CoinBase API

  - Contest Score Updater
    - run periodically (daily at first)
    - for each contest, it calculates the number of points scored per crypto asset based on the contest rules and the metrics collected from the crypto metrics collector
    - it will then update the number of points scored per contest entry

  - LeaderBoard
    - should be able to show leader board per contest
    - possibly some type of aggregate leader board for power users

  - Coinbase Data Parser
    - We want to outsource as much as the data collection to Coinbase as possible
    - New crypto assets will be added to our system when they are added to coin base
    - Crypto assets will be removed from our system when they are removed from coin base
    - Descriptions/white paper urls/ other meta data will be updated when coin base updates them
